In brief, there are 2 different ways to comment in Swift:

1. type1: Using `/*` `*/`
2. type2: Using multiple single-line comments, `//`

These are explained in detail below.

### swift-type1.swift
> For this type, comments *normally* begin with `/*` and end with `*/`. *File-level* comments contain five `*` instead of one. It is up to you how you want to `tab` or `space` stuff inside. The comments are as follows:

A *file-level* multi-line Swift comment with `/*` and `*/` :

	/*****
	stuff
	*****/

A *normal* multi-line Swift comment with `/*` and `*/` :

	/*
	stuff
	*/

----------------------------------
### swift-type2.swift
> For this type, comments are composed of several single lined comments, which are made from `//`. *File-level* comments will begin with five `/`, followed by single line comments with three `/`, and ended with five more `/` on a new line. Furthermore, *normal* multi-line comments also feature three `/`. It is up to you how you want to `tab` or `space` stuff inside. The comments are as follows:

A *file-level* multi-line Swift comment with `/` :

	
	/////
	///
	/// stuff
	///
	/////

A *normal* multi-line Swift comment with `/` :
	
	///
	/// stuff
	///

A *normal* single-line Swift comment with `/` :

	// stuff
